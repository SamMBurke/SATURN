# Overview
Despite impressive advances in the control of modern myoelectric prosthetic devices, the current lack of sensory feedback remains a challenge, often cited as the primary cause of user dissatisfaction and device abandonment. SATURN (Sensory Awareness of Touch Upper-Limb Radial Network) aims to improve users' ability to interact with objects in their surrounding environment by sensing force at the fingertips and delivering pressure information to the user's phantom hand map via inflatable air bladders placed inside the socket. SATURN incorporates customized design elements, and is compatible with a range of prosthetic devices.

This project moved to earn $2550 through 2 consecutive awards through the Engineer of the Future Fund and was a grand prize winner of the [Esch Pitch Competition 2024](https://uwaterloo.ca/news/engineering/eweal-decade-winning-ideas). The device wan on the basis of design novelty, prospective real-world impact, and economic viability.

This is the code regarding the implementation, assessment, verification and validation of the SATURN project.
